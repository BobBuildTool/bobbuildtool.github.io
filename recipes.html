						Bob recipes are Yaml files that collectively describe the whole structure of a project,
						including their tools. Each recipe describes how a package is built and what the input, such as
						source code or other packages, is.  A typical recipe looks like this:

					<p class="c-paragraph">
						The recipes describe packages in a functional manner. They define the input (source code, other
						packages, environment variables and tools), how the package is built and what the final output
						is. In contrast to the usual "sysroot"-approach of other build systems Bob will keep packages
						separate from each other in the file system. Given this functional approach Bob can track
						changes very effectively and minimize undetected cross-package dependencies.

					<h2 class="c-heading u-xlarge c-text--mono">inherit</h2>

						Inherit common definitions and functionality from classes. They are used to factor out repeatedly
						used functions, like supporting standard build systems. Classes can inherit each other.

				<div class="o-grid__cell o-grid__cell--width-33">
					<h2 class="c-heading u-xlarge c-text--mono">depends</h2>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Only declared dependencies are accessible when the package is built. Each dependency is kept in
						a separete workspace to not mix results so that changes can be tracked accurately.

					<h2 class="c-heading u-xlarge c-text--mono">checkoutSCM</h2>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Defines one or more sources of the package. Bob has built-in support for fetching URLs (e.g.
						http), git, svn and cvs. An additional <tt>checkoutScript</tt> can be used for advanced stuff like
						applying patches.

				<div class="o-grid__cell o-grid__cell--width-33">
					<h2 class="c-heading u-xlarge c-text--mono">buildVars</h2>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Bob tightly controls the environment variables that are set during the script execution. Only
						declared variables will be available at built time. Using this knowledge Bob can track which
						variables have an impact on what packages.

				<div class="o-grid__cell o-grid__cell--width-33">
					<h2 class="c-heading u-xlarge c-text--mono">buildScript</h2>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						A bash script that builds the package. In this case a shell function defined by the autotools
						class is used that does all the heavy lifting. All scripts are run with <tt>errexit</tt>,
						<tt>nounset</tt> and <tt>pipefail</tt> to detect errors early.

					<p class="c-paragraph">
						This bash script extracts the final result from the build workspace. In this case the recipe
						uses the standard function from the autotools class. The files left in the workspace by this
						script are the result of the package.

					<h2 class="c-heading u-super">Special kinds of recipes</h2>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Despite the regular recipes as shown above there are special kinds that describe the build
						environment. They complete the holistic approach of Bob to control all aspects of the sofware
						build. Except the usage of some additional keywords they are like any other recipe.

				<div class="o-grid__cell o-grid__cell--width-50 u-letter-box--large">
					<h2 class="c-heading u-xlarge">Tool recipes</h2>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Tool recipes bring in build tools that are used during package compilation. Tools have a name
						and are declared by the <tt>provideTools</tt> keyword. Typically this is the C(++)-compiler but
						it could be any tool that is required, e.g. flex, bison, protoc, you name it.  They can be
						downloaded or even built with the project.

					<h2 class="c-heading u-xlarge">Sandbox recipes</h2>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						A sandbox is used to almost fully virtualize the host build environment. It is declared by a
						<tt>provideSandbox</tt> keyword. Think of it as a file system image which is used by Bob to
						create a fresh temporary container for each package that is built. Bob uses
						<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user namespaces</a> so
						that no root priviliges are needed.
