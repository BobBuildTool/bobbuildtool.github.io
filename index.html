					<p class="u-large">
						Bob is a functional build automation tool with an
						emphasisis on cross compilation. It is intended for
						complex embedded projects and thus focuses on
						reproducible builds while still being nice to
						developers in agile environments.

					<h2 class="c-heading u-super">What makes Bob different?</h2>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						In contrast to similar tools Bob tries to bridge the
						gap between a classic package build system that
						reliably builds hundreds of packages and a working
						environment where individual developers can work on
						their applications. Bob strives to be fast, reliable
						and reproducible while still being the core of a
						continuous integration work flow.

						<i class="fas fa-file-alt fa-5x"></i>
						<h3 class="c-heading u-xlarge">One description to rule'em all</h3>
					</a>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Bob recipes describe everything how the software is
						built. Build, edit, re-build and test your packages
						exactly the same way as the CI server would build them.
						If it builds locally then it will build on the CI
						server too and vice versa.

						<h3 class="c-heading u-xlarge">Jenkins CI integration</h3>
					</a>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Bob will configure a Jenkins server right from the
						recipes. No need to to deal separately with the CI
						setup. Spend less time debugging your Jenkins jobs
						because everything is already described in the recipes.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="o-grid__cell o-grid__cell--width-33 u-window-box--super">
					<i class="fas fa-database fa-5x"></i>
					<h3 class="c-heading u-xlarge">Binary Artifacts</h3>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Why build a package locally if the CI server or someone
						else has built it already? Bob can use a binary
						artifact cache to fetch compatible artifacts. Despite
						a shared location no special setup is needed. Use your
						CPU to compile packages you're working on, not the
						prerequisites that everybody else has built already.

					<i class="fas fa-code-branch fa-5x"></i>
					<h3 class="c-heading u-xlarge">Variant management</h3>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Recipes declare their input and the required steps to
						build the package.  Depending on the configured
						environment Bob automatically computes how many
						variants of a package must be built. E.g. building the
						same recipe with different compilers in the same
						project is as easy as checking out different source
						code for a package for different platforms.

					<h3 class="c-heading u-xlarge">Enable reproducible builds</h3>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Bob's functional approach makes all input to a package
						explicitly visible. Bob can virtualise the build
						environment with a sandbox. In the sandbox all paths
						are host independent, only declared input is accessible
						read-only and just the workspace is writeable. No
						possibility for the configure script to see a stray
						library that was not declared.

					<h3 class="c-heading u-xlarge">Audit trail</h3>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Every artifact has an audit trail attached to it
						describing all input and processing steps that have led
						to it. The audit trail shows what has been built where
						and when with what recipes. This works across local and
						Jenkins builds.

					<h3 class="c-heading u-xlarge">Embedded Linux systems</h3>
					<p class="c-paragraph">
						Just like Bitbake and Buildroot you can use Bob to
						build a custom embedded Linux image. Bob makes it very
						easy to add your own applications in this environment
						and immediately test them in the final image. Build
						upon stable packages and develop your applications in a
						true CI setup to accelerate development. See the
						basement project for a starting point.

						Bob supports building firmware images for devices that
						contain cores with different architectures. For example
						a device could have an Application core, as DSP and a
						microcontroller. Bob supports this setup, especially if
						some code is shared between the different cores.
